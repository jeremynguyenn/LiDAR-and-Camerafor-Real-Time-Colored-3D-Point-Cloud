## Features  
- **Real-Time 3D Point Cloud Generation**: Combines LiDAR data and images for colored 3D point clouds.  
- **Edge Device Optimization**: Designed to work efficiently on single-board computers.  
- **Simplified Workflow**: All processing is consolidated in a single pipeline for ease of use.

## Prerequisites  
- **Hardware**:  
  - 2D LiDAR sensor (recommend Slamtec RPLIDAR A1)
  - Camera module compatible with `libcamera` (recommend rev 1.3 camera module)
  - Servo motors (for LiDAR adjustment, recommend Mg996r)
  - Accelerometer (recommend ADXL345)
  - Single Board Computer (recommend Raspberry Pi 4)
- **Software**:  
  - Python (>=3.6)
  - Pi OS (recommended)

## Prototype Assembly Instructions
The STL files for the prototype can be found in the prototype folder of this repository. Simply download the files and use a 3D printer for printing.
The material used for printing is PLA 1.75mm filament, with a layer height of 0.2mm for optimal results.
There is also a video of the mounting process. Feel free to download, if necessary.
